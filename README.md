<h1>3D Engine Software Implementation</h1>

Inspired by CoderSpace.

This repository contains a 3D engine software implementation written in Python, utilizing the Pygame and NumPy modules. The engine allows users to create and render 3D scenes, manipulate objects, and apply lighting and shading effects. The engine also supports basic physics simulations and camera movement. The implementation is designed to be user-friendly and customizable.
